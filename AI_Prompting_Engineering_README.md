# AI Prompting Engineering

## Overview
This project explores **prompt engineering** techniques for AI models, focusing on creativity, narrative generation, and scenario simulations. It demonstrates how well-crafted prompts can guide large language models to generate useful outputs for science fiction writing, narrative warfare simulations, and strategic analysis.

## Features
- Examples of effective prompt structures for creative writing and technical tasks
- Use cases in **geopolitics, law, and AI policy**
- Practical exercises for learning how to design prompts
- Documentation for adapting prompts to different AI models

## Setup
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/ai-prompting-engineering.git
cd ai-prompting-engineering
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
- Run the example notebooks in `notebooks/`
- Customize prompts for **creative writing** or **analysis scenarios**
- Record variations and compare results
